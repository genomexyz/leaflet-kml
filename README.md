# Leaflet KML layer plugin

![Example](assets/ss2.png)

Demo: https://www.windy.com/uploader

This plugin was extracted from Pavel Shramov's Leaflet Plugins [repository](https://github.com/shramov/leaflet-plugins) in order to maintain this code more frequently and separate KML layer from other plugins.

I fix some issue in original repo.

Probablly will work on Leaflet 1+, tested on Leaflet 1.4.
